# Gamepad
  NOTE: These do not have parentheses because they are not methods. However, because they are public fields, you can use them very similarly to methods.
  
  Our gamepads are named gamepad1 and gamepad2 and can be used interchangably for the fields.
  ### boolean fields:
  
  ```java
gamepad1.a
gamepad1.b
gamepad1.back
gamepad1.dpad_down
gamepad1.dpad_up
gamepad1.dpad_left
gamepad1.dpad_right
gamepad1.guide
gamepad1.left_bumper
gamepad1.right_bumper
gamepad1.left_stick_button
gamepad1.right_stick_button
gamepad1.start
gamepad1.x
gamepad1.y
  ```
### integer fields:
  #####  These fields represent a value between -1 and 1 based on the position of the control stick:
 ```java
gamepad1.right_stick_x
gamepad1.left_stick_x
gamepad1.right_stick_y
gamepad1.left_stick_y
  ```

  
 #####   These fields represent a value between 0 and 1 based on the position of the trigger:
   ```java
gamepad1.right_trigger
gamepad1.left_trigger
  ```
